# Exercise 1

According to the plot `failureProbability.pdf`, most of the spikes are close to zero.
That is, most of them are not statistically significant. 
This means that the failure probability for each time is not highly correlated with the others. 
In our settings for the Bayesian model, we assume a beta prior on the `failureProbability`. 
The uncorrelated result from `failureProbability.pdf` match the prior on randomness.

# Exercise 2

$\gamma (x,z) = \text{prior} (p) \prod_{i=1}^{4} \text{likelihood} (x_i | p)$

$\text{likelihood} (x_i | p) = p^{x_i} (1-p)^{1-x_i}$

The joint distribution of $Z, X_1, \dots , X_4$ is $\gamma (x,z) = f_{X, Z} (x1, \dots, x4, p) = \prod_{i=1}^{4} p^{x_i} (1-p)^{1-x_i} \times 1 = p^{\sum x_i} (1-p)^{n- \sum x_i}$.

Let $s = x_1 + \dots + x_4$, the marginal distribution of $X_1, \dots , X_4$ can be calculated by integrating $\gamma (x,z)$ over $p$:

$f_X(x_1, \dots, x_4) = \int_{0}^{1} p^{s}(1-p)^{4-s}dp = B(s+1, 4-s+1)$ where $B(a,b) = \frac{\Gamma (a) \Gamma (b)}{\Gamma (a + b)}$. 


# Exercise 3

As we have derived the marginal distribution, then, the posterior distribution of $Z$ given $X_1 = x_1, \dots, X_4 = x_4$ has the PDF as:

$f_{Z|X} (p|x_1, ..., x_4) = \frac{f_{X,Z}(x_1, \dots, x_4, p)}{f_X (x1, \dots, x_4)} = \frac{p^s (1-p)^{4-s}}{B(s+1, 4-s+1)}$

As the values of first three $X_i$ are given by zero, the PDF becomes:

$f_{Z|X} (p|x_1, ..., x_4) = \frac{p^s (1-p)^{4-s}}{B(s+1, 4-s+1)}$ where $s = x_4$.

Therefore, $f_{Z|X} (p|x1, ..., x_4) = \frac{p^{x_4} (1-p)^{4- x_{4}}}{B(x_{4}+1, 5-x_{4})}$
