# Exercise 1
When $\mu = 0.5$, I get the credible interval as $(0.00086373314343105,0.452371514565394)$.

When $\mu = 0.1$, I get the credible interval as
$(2.20578504541744e-09,0.122590935179599)$

# Exercise 2
Because there are irrugular data points in the sample set.
For example, one type of rocket may only have 2 lauches in total but 1 or 2 of them are failure. Then such extreme situation will be expressed through the MLE approach. 

# Exercise 3
When $\mu = 0.5$, I get the credible interval as $(8.7126566008768e-07,0.194312058356585)$.

When $\mu = 0.1$, I get the credible interval as
$(6.59781036995842e-07,0.191303934387083)$
